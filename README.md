# Salary Clarity Finder

A single-page tool that scores job postings for pay transparency, highlights missing details, and suggests quick fixes. Everything runs locally in your browserâ€”no uploads or tracking.

## Getting started

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
2. Paste the full text of a job ad into the "Paste job posting" box (optionally add the posting URL to help detect locations).
3. Click **Analyze** to generate a transparency score, law compliance check, detected facts, and suggested fixes.
4. Copy the generated summary to share feedback with recruiters or hiring managers.

Use the provided **Load sample** button to explore the scoring without pasting your own posting.
